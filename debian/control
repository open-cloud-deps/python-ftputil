Description: High-level FTP client library
 ftputil is a high-level FTP client library for the Python programming
 language. ftputil implements a virtual file system for accessing FTP servers,
 that is, it can generate file-like objects for remote files. The library
 supports many functions similar to those in the os, os.path and shutil
 modules. ftputil has convenience functions for conditional uploads and
 downloads, and handles FTP clients and servers in different timezones.
